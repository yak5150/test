Kaci,
Lately, I have been getting frustrated with how you have been treating my presence. It would make me feel more appreciated if you tried to acknowledge me when I speak to you or when we are in the same space. I understand we not always eachothers focus; however, I think it's important to listen for one another. I also know that Margaret is an important to you as a friend and colleague. Often, I feel ignored becuase you physically leave me behind or get carried away in conversation with her... without acknowledging my presence. A simple heads up of what you're doing or where you going when doing stuff makes a big difference to me. It's crucial for us to make sure eachothers feeling are accounted for. Thank you for hearing me out.
Love, Jakob
